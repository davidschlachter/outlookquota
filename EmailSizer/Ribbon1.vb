'   Ribbon designer, move your code from the event handlers to the callback methods and
'   modify the code to work with the Ribbon extensibility (RibbonX) programming model.

'3. Assign attributes to the control tags in the Ribbon XML file to identify the appropriate callback methods in your code.
